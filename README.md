# Freshworks Assignment


## Project Stack:

* Kotlin
* Clean Architecture
* MVVM
* Koin
* Retrofit
* Kotlin Coroutines
* Navigation Component
* Glide



Notes:
- I could separate layers (Data/Domain/Presentation) to different modules but due to size of the project it I didn't.
- I added some UnitTest & Instrumented tests (I couldn't do it for ll scenarios and layers because of my time limits).
- For sure in bigger project we move all Gradle dependencies in PROJECT gradle and just use them in modules gradle for keeping centralization
